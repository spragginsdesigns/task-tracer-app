# Task-Tracer To-Do List App

Task-Tracer is a simple and intuitive to-do list application built with TypeScript. It helps keep track of your daily tasks in a clear and organized manner.

## Description

The Task-Tracer app allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks from their to-do list. Each task can be marked as completed or be deleted if it's no longer relevant. This project is great for those who want to understand the basics of TypeScript and how it can be used to enhance JavaScript applications.

## Installation

To run Task-Tracer locally, follow these steps:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/spragginsdesigns/task-tracer.git
cd task-tracer
# If you have Node.js and npm installed:
npm install
npm run build
# Open public/index.html in your browser
```

## Usage

After opening `index.html` in your browser, you should see the Task-Tracer interface. Here's how to use it:

- To add a task, type the task description and press the "Add" button or hit Enter.
- To mark a task as complete, click on the checkbox next to the task.
- To remove a task, click on the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove.
